# Portfolio

**Hi, I am Md Irshad. I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I love to do Frontend and Backend with DevOps. I have been learning these technologies for more than a year. During my journey I have learn a lot from doing projects. In this project I have built my portfolio web application using React, Redux with Webpack for Frontend and Firebase for Authentication, Database. We are not implementing a severless function because it will be like an overhead for our simple Progressive Web Application.**
